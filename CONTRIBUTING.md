# Contributing an idea for a data course to Census Academy

The Census Bureau welcomes ideas for courses that will teach Americans how to use Census data for school, work, research, software, or other projects. We're looking for short, engaging, video-based courses like you'd see on Khan Academy, Udacity, or other online course platforms.

Anyone can submit an idea here. If your idea is approved, experts at the Census Bureau will record and produce the video and ultimately publish it on Census Academy. We'll attribute you for the idea and content, of course!

## Requirements

The course you propose must be made of only videos. These videos will be produced on YouTube, so make sure you only request features that YouTube supports. In addition, **each video must be between 1 and 15 minutes in length**, and the total length of all videos in your course must not exceed 90 minutes.

## Submitting an idea

Have an idea? Here's how you can submit it to the Census Bureau.

1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/data-course-ideas/issues/new) (basically, a discussion thread). [Here's an example of how to fill out the issue](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/data-course-ideas/issues/1).
2. Create a script document, following the format in [this sample script document](courses/template/README.md). Please attach the script to your issue as a .docx file (which you can create with Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or other apps) or Markdown file. **We cannot accept PDFs!**
3. Submit the issue, and we'll start a conversation! We'll review your script and possibly suggest changes, and if your script is ready for production, we'll have our team of experts at the Census Bureau film it!
