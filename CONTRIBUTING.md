# Contributing an idea for a data course to Census Academy

The Census Bureau welcomes ideas for courses that will teach Americans how to use Census data for school, work, research, software, or other projects. We're looking for short, engaging, video-based courses like you'd see on Khan Academy, Udacity, or other online course platforms.

Anyone can submit an idea here. If your idea is approved, experts at the Census Bureau will record and produce the video and ultimately publish it on Census Academy. We'll attribute you for the idea and content, of course!

Want to submit an idea for a course? Here's how.

1. Make a fork of this repository.
2. Duplicate the `courses/template/` folder and rename it to something like the name of your course (try to avoid spaces). So it could be called something like `courses/my-cool-course/`.
3. Edit the `README.md` to include a summary of your course, as well as scripts, storyboards, and other assets your course's videos will require. The template README will give you some tips.

  - This has to be written in Markdown, a lightweight syntax for simple writing. [Check out the official guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) if you need help.
  - You need to structure your course into a series of 3-10 minute long videos.
  - Check out our sample course at `courses/sample/` for more examples of how you would write this file.

4. Once you're happy with your writeup, submit a pull request to the original repository! We'll review it and, if it's complete and high-quality enough, we'll add it to our official list of courses for the Census Academy.

Need more help? Ask Jeff Meisel at jeffrey.meisel@census.gov, or open up an issue on this repository and we'll be in touch.
