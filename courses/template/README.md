## Video 1: Video Name

_Approximate video length, in minutes_

### Video Description

Provide a short, paragraph-long description for the video. We'll use this in the description of your video on YouTube.

### Script

In this script section, write what the video narrator would be saying.

_Indicate "stage directions" in italics, like this. For instance, you can indicate clicking on things (if it's not obvious from the script), opening apps or files, or displaying certain graphics._

Feel free to include pictures or screenshots in the script to clarify what the narrator should be doing.

### Video Format

The Census Bureau can produce videos in a variety of formats. Mention which format you would prefer, and provide any supplemental materials in this section. Options include:

* **A narrator voicing over a screen capture**. That is, someone talking over a recorded laptop screen. In this case, the narrator will talk following the script and take actions on their computer based on the instructions provided in the script.
* **A narrator talking over slides**. In this case, please attach a PowerPoint file to your GitHub issue, or link to a public Google Slides presentation here. In the script, indicate when the narrator should move to the next slide.
* **A "talking head"**. We can record someone speaking in front of a Census-branded background, optionally with a lower third. [Here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKNJpcJKYAE).

### Additional Resources

Here you can link to a thumbnail image you'd like us to use, datasets that might be useful when we're producing the video, a translated transcript, or other materials that may be useful.
