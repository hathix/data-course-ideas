## Video 1: Video Name

### Script

Each video should be 3-10 minutes long. In this script section, write what the video narrator would be saying.

> Indicate "stage directions" like this. For instance, you can indicate clicking on things (if it's not obvious from the script), opening apps or files, or displaying certain graphics.

### Visuals

Explain what visuals should accompany the spoken script. The simplest visual is a screen capture with a voiceover. You can also ask for slides to be voiced over (in which case, provide links to the slides here) or ask for someone to talk in front of a green screen (in which case, specify what the background and visual aids should be.)

### Additional Resources

Here you can link to images we can use for thumbnails, copies of your slide decks, files we should link to in the video description, or other assets that we should include with the audio/video content. We suggest putting your content in a `resources` folder.
