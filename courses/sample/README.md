# Sample Course: How to get population data for your state
> By Neel Mehta, Civic Digital Fellow at the US Census Bureau

## Summary

This sample course will teach you how to use the Census Bureau's American FactFinder tool to gather population data for your state. You'll be able to see how many people live in your state and which counties are the biggest.

## Why this course?

American FactFinder is one of Census's most popular tools, and a video tutorial for new users would be very helpful.

## Video 1: Accessing American FactFinder

### Script

Hi and welcome to this sample course! I'm Neel from the Census Bureau.

Today we'll show you how to use American FactFinder to get income data for your state. First, go to census.gov and click on "Data" in the top bar. Then click on "Data Tools and Apps", then "American FactFinder".

Then you'll be at American FactFinder!

### Visuals

In this video, we'll do a screen capture with a voiceover to show people how to walk through the website.

## Video 2: Finding your state

### Script

Hi and welcome back! Again, we're at the American FactFinder, which you can find at factfinder.census.gov.

From here, type your state name into the "Community Facts" search bar. We'll choose Maryland because the Census Bureau is located in Suitland, Maryland.

Hit Go.

You'll see the population of your state! In this case, Maryland's population is just under 5.8 million.

### Visuals

We'll again do a screen capture and voiceover.

### Additional Resources

Put a link to AFF in the video description: <https://factfinder.census.gov/>.

## Video 3: Finding county populations

### Script

Welcome back to our last video! We've found that Maryland has 5.8 million people. But which counties are the biggest? From the Maryland page, click "Compare Counties for Population, Housing, Area, and Density".

We'll go to a page that lists all the counties in Maryland and the population of each. Which counties are the biggest? It looks like Montgomery County is the biggest, with almost a million people. Baltimore and Prince George's County are pretty big too.

Finally, let's download this data so we could do some advanced analysis. Go to the "Actions" bar and hit "Download". Then choose "Use the Data", then "Download."

Congrats - we're finished the course!

### Visuals

Again, a screen capture and voiceover.

### Additional Resources

By the end of the course, users should have downloaded a file called `DEC_10_SF1_GCTPH1.ST05_with_ann.csv`. I've included the file they should get and linked to it below. Please include a link to this file in the video description so that viewers can check that they got the right data.
