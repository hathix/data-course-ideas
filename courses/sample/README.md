## Video 2: Finding your state

### Script

Hi and welcome back! Again, we're at the American FactFinder, which you can find at factfinder.census.gov.

From here, type your state name into the "Community Facts" search bar. We'll choose Maryland because the Census Bureau is located in Suitland, Maryland.

Hit Go.

You'll see the population of your state! In this case, Maryland's population is around 6 million.
