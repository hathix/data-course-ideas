# Submit your data course ideas for Census Academy

The [US Census Bureau](https://census.gov) is launching [Census Academy](https://uscensusbureau.github.io/census-academy/), a video-based training platform to teach Americans how to use Census data. As we launch, we're crowdsourcing great ideas for courses from the American people.

Are you an expert in technology, demographics, geography, education, politics, data science, or any of the fields that touch Census data? We invite you to submit a course idea!
